Before I ended up with Github pages, I came across this ASP.Net site to Get started with ASP.NET Boilerplate using a free or premium startup template.
> ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP) is an open source and well-documented application framework. It's not just a framework, it also provides a strong architectural model based on Domain Driven Design, with all the best practices in mind.
ABP works with the latest ASP.NET Core & EF Core but also supports ASP.NET MVC 5.x & EF 6.x as well.

[Check this site to build your own site using ABP.](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Introduction)
