There are many other options I've explored to create this site

Landed on to develop with Githubpages, VSCode, Ruby and Jekyll.

Step1: On my machine I've installed the following:

[Ruby + DevKit - latest version]( https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)

Install Bundler using the following cmdlet $ gem install jekyll bundler

[Visual Studio Code]( https://code.visualstudio.com/download )

Jekyll

[Git Windows Desktop](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

When you install GIT make sure the default editor is set to VS code.

For detailed instructions following these two links which will guide you to setup and create your site.

Jekyll have may themes which one can leverage to build a site.

I've picked MinimalMistakes theme to build this site.

While building I needed to verify my config.yml file. You can use the following site to verify [Yaml Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/)
